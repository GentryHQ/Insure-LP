## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS/SCSS: CSS preprocessor





### What I learned

- My first time using SASS, and I learnt a lot from building this project with SASS... From Syntax to best practices to functions and other superpower with SASS. Although my code was a little rough around the end as I just trying to grasp the concepts in SASS.

- I did little animation with CSS which I haven't tried out before.


### Continued development

- I will definitely continue with sass for my future projects, I will also like to rebuild this project sometimes in the future with SASS. 


### Useful resources

- Brad Travesy YT Channel - Brad has a nicely done and well explained video on SASS. And this was the first tutorial I watched before doing anything with SASS. You should take a look


- The Net Ninja YT Channel - Here, a playlist that walk you through installation to very advance level on SASS.
